 ❛❛  <i>What will I do now that you're gone?</i>   ❞

<p align="center">
HALLO THERE! You can call me Bell or Brutus, <br>
  or any nicknames you have in mind! ^_^ <br>
  Any terms except masc, main pronouns are she / they,  <br>
  but I don't mind others as long as they aren't masculine. 

<p align="center">
  Feel free to interact with, unless told underwise!  <br>
  Please do note that I tend to get nervous and have social anxiety,  <br>
  so it might take me a second to answer if I'm on tab!<br>
  Feel free to c*+h unless I'm with friends or told otherwise!

 <p align="center">
Current fandoms are -  Blocktales , lifes purpose, HWWHP / ^_^ , <br>
Forsaken, Die of death, Gravity falls, Rick and Morty, Grace, <br>
Adventure time / Fionna and cake, Physiological roblox horror games,  and more!

 <p align="center"> 
 Feel free to vent to me whenever, unless status says otherwise! <br>
Other then that, you can freely whisper me even if I don't know you, <br>
everyone deserves to have someone to talk to reguardless of their situation! <br>
I enjoy being helpful even If I'm not the best at comforting!
